## Task topic
Modify the Example View plugin in the open-source MITK software, so it performs a k-means clustering algorithm on a brain scan file in the .nii format and returns clustered pixel coordinates. The pixels should be clustered in four dimensions, considering their 3D position and their value, so the algorithm can be used to extract brain tumour from the scan.
